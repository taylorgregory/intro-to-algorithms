# intro-to-algorithms
Implementation of several basic sorting and searching algorithms in C#. Featured algorithms include:

SequentialSearch - Searches for a given value in a given array by sequential search
ArrayMax - Returns the value of the largest number in a given array
IsSorted - Returns true if all the numbers in a given array are sorted in ascending order
MinDistance - Returns the separation of
ReverseArray -
BinarySearch -
InsertionSort -

.... etc.
